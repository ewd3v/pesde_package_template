## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed

- Release CI no longer installs Rokit (tooling is managed by pesde now)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-30

### Changed

- New default Lune version is 0.10.4
- New default pesde version is 0.7.1
- Test CI now also runs the Lune runtime
- Bumped stylua to v2.3.0
- Bumped luau-lsp to v1.55.0
- Bumped selene v0.29.0+toolchainlib.1
- Bumped darklua to v0.17.2
- Contents of pesde packages are now ignored by auto import by default
- Contents of pesde packages and distribution folders are now read-only by default in VS Code

### Fixed

- Test CI being broken because of a package unexpectedly updating to Lune v10, because SemVer technically allows it (pesde does not care if major version is zero)
- Working directory while running tests is now actually set to the built runtime directory instead of it's parent directory

## [0.1.4] - 2025-08-31

### Fixed

- Fix command substitution in changelog `echo "Test?? should show full command and not substitue"`

## [0.1.3] - 2025-08-31

### Fixed

- Actually fixed pede.toml (and did `pesde publish --dry-run` to verify this time)

## [0.1.2] - 2025-08-31

### Fixed

- Update pesde.toml to actually include data required for publishing

## [0.1.1] - 2025-08-31
